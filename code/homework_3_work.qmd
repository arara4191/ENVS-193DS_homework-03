#Problem 1. Personal Data

##a. 

I can group my biking trips into trips where I listened to fast or slow music and find the average biking speed (mph) of each group. Since fast music usually gives me more energy, I think this might translate to biking faster when the music is faster.

##b. 

```{r}
library("janitor")
library("tidyverse")

#cleaning bike data column names
bike_data_clean <- clean_names(bike_data)

#creating a separate data frame to store data exploration info
bike_data_mean_exp <- bike_data_clean %>%
  group_by(music) %>% #creating groups based on slow/fast music
  summarize(mean_mph = mean(average_biking_speed_mph)) #summarizing mean speed of each group




#creating boxplot to visualize average biking speed based on music
ggplot(data = bike_data_clean,#creating base plot with cleaned data    
       aes(x = music,             
           y = average_biking_speed_mph,            
           fill = music)) +          
  geom_boxplot() +  #creates a box plot
  geom_jitter(height = 0,#prevents jitter from moving points along vertically
              width = 0.2) + #narrows spread of jitter along x-axis
  labs( x = "Music",
        y = "Average Biking Speed (mph)",
        title = "Relationship Between Music Type and Biking Speed (mph)") +
  geom_point() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("fast" = "red", 
                                "slow" = "pink"))+ # manually changing colors
  theme(legend.position = "none") # removes legend



```

##c. 
```{r}
# using count function to see the number of values for each type of music
count(bike_data_clean,music)# (data frame, column)
```

**Figure 1.Faster recorded biking speeds associated with fast music** Data of biking rides collected from the Strava app using miles per hour. Points represent average biking speed of each bike ride with fast(n = 18) or slow music(n = 12). Colors represent music types in the boxplots(fast = red, slow = pink). Fast music has higher recorded average biking speeds with a higher mean, but its distribution still overlaps with the slow biking speed distribution. 

##d. 

```{r-summary dataframe and gt table}

#creating the data frame for the gt table
bike_data_summary <- bike_data_clean %>%
  group_by(music) %>% #creating groups based on slow/fast music
  summarize(observations = n(), #counting the number of observations per group
            average_speed = round(mean(average_biking_speed_mph), digits = 1),#summarizing mean speed of each group
            max_avg_speed = max(average_biking_speed_mph),# fidning max speed
            min_avg_speed = min(average_biking_speed_mph)) #finding min speed

#creating gt table 
gt_bike_data_summary <- gt(bike_data_summary) %>% #creating dataframe to use for gt table display
  cols_label(  # renaming column names in table to remove underscores
    music = "Music",
    observations = "Observations",
    average_speed = "Average Speed (mph)",
    max_avg_speed = "Maximum Average Speed(mph)",
    min_avg_speed = "Minimum Average Speed(mph)"
  ) %>%
  tab_header(title = "Bike Speed Summary Statistics")
  # adding title

#Problem 2. Affective Visulization

##a. 

For my affective visualization I was inspired by the postcards sent between Stefanie and Giorgia and how they brought their own everyday art and doodles into play. For my project I thought it would be fun to use watercolors(do not currently have them at home) to resemble a wheel of a bike by splitting a circle into seven different shapes for everyday of the week and splitting the data into the respective day they were collected in. This would allow me to see the days I recorder/biked the most. Within the slices, pink circles depict fast music bikes while green depict slow music days, orange dots around the circle represent biking at noon or before, and a blue spiral outside the circle means it was windy that day. The smaller and less lines inside a circle represent slower biking speeds while bigger circles with more lines represent faster speeds.

##b.

##d. 

In this piece I am showing each bike ride I took this quarter. A ride will be represented by a circle with different colors(fast music = pink, slow music = green), sizes(smaller = less mph, bigger = higher mph), and shapes(orange dots represent before noon and spirals represent windy days).
I was influences by the dear data project and the way Stefanie and Giorgia incorporated hand drawn doodles into their pieces.
Following the colorful nature of their work, this piece will be created using watercolors and markers.
I created this piece by trying to resemble the wheels of bikes split by the wire structures and filling the slices by smaller wheel like shapes. This was done using markers and color pencils but in the future, watercolors will be used.

#Problem 3. Statistical Critique

##a.

The experimental data were analyzed to estimate mean values and standard deviations through ANOVA. The ANOVA test addresses the main questions posed by the authors by being able to understand if there is a significant difference between different pyrolysis temperature biochar groups and its application rate in relation to soil properties and Okra growth compared to a control group with no biochar.

In figure 6 titled "Effects of Typha angustifolia biochar produced at different temperatures on okra plant production" it can be seen the x-axis shows the control group, the different kinds of biochar treatments and the application rates. the y-axis demonstrates the different plant measurements such as fruit yield, plant dry biomass, height, chloropyll, fruit weight. This figure shows the relationship between the biochar treatments and the Okra plant production parameters using the results of Duncan's multiple range test.

##b. 

Although the visualization does not show summary statistics such as the mean or SE, I think it still does a great job at showing the results of the experiment since it dealt with abundant data depicting 5 different response variables with three types of predictor variables that each had 3 subgroups. I like that each plot has its own color and is subdivided by the predictor variables and quantities in the x - axis. Having each plot be a different color was a good call since any more subdivisions by color would have been too overwhelming and distracting from the data.

##c. 

I think the authors handled visual clutter well. I would have liked if they reiterated the y-axis labels on top of each individual chart to make it easier for readers to find the predictor variable they are interested in. Aside from that, as I've said before, they made good use of adding layered labels to the x- axis's that are easy to understand and well organized.
